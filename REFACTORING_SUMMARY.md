# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The monolithic `index.ts` (1500+ lines) has been split into a modular structure following best practices.

## Created Structure

```
src/
├── types/index.ts              ✅ Created - All type definitions
├── ai/
│   ├── systemPrompt.ts         ✅ Created - System prompt configuration
│   ├── openai.ts               ✅ Created - OpenAI client and logging
│   └── conversation.ts         ✅ Created - Conversation management
├── game/
│   ├── movement.ts             ✅ Created - Movement and navigation
│   ├── blocks.ts               ✅ Created - Block placement logic
│   └── inventory.ts            ✅ Created - Inventory management
├── building/
│   ├── buildManager.ts         ✅ Created - Build project management
│   └── structures.ts           ✅ Created - Structure generation
├── tasks/
│   └── taskManager.ts          ✅ Created - Task management
├── dashboard/
│   ├── server.ts               ✅ Created - Express server
│   ├── websocket.ts            ✅ Created - WebSocket handling
│   └── state.ts                ✅ Created - State snapshots
└── tools/
    ├── toolDefinitions.ts      ✅ Created - Tool schemas
    └── toolExecutor.ts         ⏳ Pending - Tool execution logic
```

## Next Steps

The following files still need to be created from the original `index.ts`:
1. `src/tools/toolExecutor.ts` - Extract executeMCPTool() function
2. `src/bot/bot.ts` - Bot initialization and configuration
3. `src/bot/eventHandlers.ts` - Bot event handlers
4. Update `src/index.ts` - New entry point that wires everything

## Implementation Notes

All modules use ES module syntax (.js extensions in imports).
Dependencies are injected where needed (bot instance passed as parameter).
No circular dependencies - clear hierarchy established.
